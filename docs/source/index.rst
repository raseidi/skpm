Welcome to SkPM's documentation!
================================

**SkPM** *(Scikit-learn for Process Mining)* is a library built upon `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ to easily write and train machine learning pipelines tailored for process mining tasks.

This work is still in progress! So far, we have focused more on feature extraction and encoding techniques to be easily used along with Scikit-learn's `pipelines <https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/compose.html>`_ and `grid search-related functionalities <https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/grid_search.html#grid-search>`_.
